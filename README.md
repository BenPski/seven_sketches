## About

The goal here is to make useful data structures and rendering tools for working
through the book [Seven Sketches in Compositionality](https://math.mit.edu/~dspivak/teaching/sp18/7Sketches.pdf).

The first couple sections introduce things like:
- equivalence relations
- partitions
- power sets
- preorders
- Hasse diagrams
and I'm quickly running out of paper already.

## General

Implementing in rust, compiling to wasm, and rendering and interacting with javascript.
Why? It seemed interesting and reasonable enough to try to figure out. Since 
this is a learning project, interesting is a good enough reason alone anyways.

## Todo

- [] Equivalence relations
- [] Paritions
  - [] generate partition from equivalence relation
  - [] generate all partitions
  - [] generate random partition
  - [] render partition
